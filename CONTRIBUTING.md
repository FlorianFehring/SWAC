## Team Collaboration Guidelines
Teams working on SmartData should organize their contributions as follows:

- **One team member forks the main repository** ([SmartData](https://github.com/FlorianFehring/SWAC)) and invites the others as **collaborators** via GitHub settings.
- All team members work within this shared fork, using **feature branches** to separate tasks and avoid conflicts.
- Changes should be submitted via **Pull Requests** and reviewed within the team before merging.
- Each team is responsible for maintaining a clean and functional team branch that reflects their current progress.

This setup ensures smooth collaboration and a unified codebase per team.
